Here, I've placed my personal projects related to automation with Python and Selenium

# Emag Automation Tests with POM Framework 

This is my project during the QA course. I learned how to use POM(Page Object Model) framework to enhance the maintainability and readability of automated tests.

Here I take the following test. At the bottom I will provide print screens with the output of test:
----------------

**Home Page** 

1. Testing the eMAG logo to ensure it's displayed on the page and has the correct 'src' image and 'alt' title attributes.
2. Testing the name of the page

**About Page**

1. Testing the name of the page 
2. Testing the NavBar to verify that the navigation buttons are displayed correctly. Create a list of the buttons and output them to the console.
